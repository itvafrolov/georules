                the pandemic COVID - 19, stagnation processes that are observed in the economy, the application of modern tools 
                and approaches that ensure its development is of particular importance. The development and implementation 
                of information systems and technologies, tools of intelligent geospatial  economy  as a new direction, 
                which is based on the provisions and approaches of the theory of economic development, the use of 
                technologies of intelligence formation and tools of information and geoinformation systems is of particular importance in this context.
            </p>            
            <p>Problematic phenomena, which are manifested in many economies of states, form the need to rethink approaches to 
                the management of economic processes at different levels, especially providing a distance form with 
                the use of information and geospatial systems. Synthesis of modern methods, models, systems allows 
                to create an intelligent geospatial  economy . In addition, for the last years the development 
                of Internet technologies and digital economy, intelligent and geospatial systems indicates the need 
                for formation and implementation of intelligent geospatial  economy  (intelectgeospates) at different levels.

            </p>
            <p>The generalizing level is evaluated by generalizing indicators, which are grouped on the basis of local indicators, 
                depending on the directions and characteristics of economic relations, territorial development, geospatial support,
                 environmental and investment policy, etc. The generalizing level uses generalizing models and coefficients

            <p>The instrumental-information model of the level of development of the intelligent geospatial economy

                    (<em>M<sub>3</sub></em>) is formed based on the collection of information about the factors  (<em>M<sub>1</sub></em>), 
                    taking into account economic, technological, stakeholder, spatial, investment, urban planning, environmental and other 
                    features, land features through instrumental means of information storage (<em>M<sub>2</sub></em>) and the selection 
                    of factors (<em>B<sub>1</sub></em>). Artificial intelligence technology is used for factor selection. The multi-level 
                    system of factors (<em>B<sub>2</sub></em>), including three levels of factors, is formed on the basis of the 
                    established system. If the multilevel system of factors according to the established criteria is built, then the saving 
                    of information by instrumental means is carried out (<em>M<sub>4</sub></em>). If "No", then again we return to updating 
                    the information about the factors of the level of development of intelligent geospatial economy, their compliance with 
                    modern conditions. Presented group of modules and blocks form the first level of hardware-information model of the level

                <li>Transition from the first level of the model to another is carried out through the hardware module of transformation 
                    of factors with indicators based on quasi-metric models (<em>M<sub>5</sub></em>). The information module of the 
                    formation of a multi-level system of indicators of the level of development of the intelligent geospatial economy

                    (<em>M<sub>7</sub></em>). Then the integral indicator of the level of development of the intelligent geospatial 
                    economy at a certain level is determined in the instrumental block behind the appropriate methods and models 
                    (<em>B<sub>64</sub></em>), the results of which are stored on the information carriers in the instrumental block 
                     (<em>M<sub>8</sub></em>). It should be noted determined on the previous block the integral indicator on the constructed 
                     scale of compliance is automatically checked the level of compliance on making and implementing decisions on

                     for determining the investment attractiveness of the region's lands is carried out. If "No", then on the third level 
                     of the model the instrumental module of refusal to implement design solutions to ensure the development of 
                     the intelligent geospatial economy (<em>M<sub>9</sub></em>) is implemented. In this case artificial intelligence

                    the integral indicator and the constructed scale (<em>M<sub>10</sub></em>) is implemented and the transition 
                    to the instrumental module of implementation of project decisions to ensure the development of the intelligent 
                    geospatial economy (<em>M<sub>11</sub></em>) is carried out. The third level and security system is formed.

                    values the implementation of design solutions for the development of intelligent geospatial economy 
                    at the appropriate levels (<em>M<sub>13</sub></em>) with the use of artificial intelligence technology is carried out. 
                    Strategic contours and directions of economic development are formed. The construction of the information 
                    security system is carried out.</li>
                <li>At the fifth level (<em>P<sub>4</sub></em>) the construction of geoinformation maps on the indicators 
                    of the development of the intelligent geospatial economy at the appropriate levels (<em>M<sub>14</sub></em>),

                    of the intelligent geospatial economy at the relevant levels (<em>M<sub>17</sub></em>) is carried out. 
                    The presented information is stored on information carriers (<em>M<sub>18</sub></em>). Considering the spatial
